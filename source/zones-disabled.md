## community.zones.a.o has been disabled

We used to have a few apps meant to help find speakers and mentors
on the community.zones.apache.org server, but those have been disabled
in Feburary 2024 as they were not enthusiastically maintained.

The pages tagged with
[speakers](/tags/speakers.html)
or
[mentoring](/tags/mentoring.html)
should provide the information that used to be there.
